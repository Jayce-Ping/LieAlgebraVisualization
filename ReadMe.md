# Lie Algebra Visualization

- E8.ipynb                                            - code for E8 picture from https://pywonderland.com/e8-and-coxeter-plane
- E8.nb                                                 - Mathematica code for E8 picture - reproducing what E8.ipynb does.
- LieAlgebraVisualization.nb            - hoped to be a general way to visualize Lie algebra.
- LieAlgebraVisualization-2.nb        - similar as LieAlgebraVisualization.nb, but a different way to connect vertices.
- figures                                              - generated by those programs.
- material                                           - related to visualization for Lie algebra.
